Hi, I'm Seu.

I'm 20 years old, born in 2000.

I'm a student at an information processing college, and I'm going to start working at an IT company in April 2021.

Recently I've been studying Vue.js, and I'd like to create a portfolio website.

My favorite thing to do is play soccer, which I do several times a month!

I look forward to working with you.
